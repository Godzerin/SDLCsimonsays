## The Source
Simon Says is a game everyone born past 1950 knows; it is a simple children's game often associated with memory and pattern recognition. This game is fantastic. It inherently can not be improved further as it is fundamentally bare-bones. Every single toy known as a "Simon Says" game has four buttons that glow in a pattern. We will add a different version of this game.
## The Proposal
Simon Says has a skill ceiling. We intend to remove this by **making the game greyscale** and adding **a new button every 3 cycles**. This will improve skill expression and make you rely less on muscle memory or color patterns.
## The Audience
We will be selling this product to young and spry children who wish for and additionally old and senile adults who wish for a nostalgic remake.
## The Goals and Visions
We want this game to be infinitely **difficult** over time. This game will not be easy even for the best of Simon Says players.
## The Key Features
The game will be **grayscale** and **increasingly difficult through addition of buttons.** It will contain all other Simon Says features, such as a randomly generated pattern, flashing buttons to express the desired pattern, and a score system.
## The Success Requirements
The game will be considered complete when all features have been implemented and the User Experience has been tuned to it's prime.
## The Technical Requirements
The game will need to run on Mobile, Tablet, Xbox, Playstation, Switch, and the Computer.
